-- We would like the role to be a foreign key to actual database roles, however
-- PostgreSQL does not support these constraints against the pg_roles table. --
-- Weâ€™ll use a trigger to manually enforce it.
-- https://postgrest.org/en/stable/how-tos/sql-user-management.html#storing-users-and-passwords
create constraint trigger ensure_user_role_exists
  after insert or update on auth.user
  for each row execute procedure auth.check_role_exists();
