_Ply_ is a **Postgres migration tool** that make database changes easy.

## Overview

Ply extends the [Sqitch](https://sqitch.org/) Docker image, adding templates
and commands to make creating common migrations simple. For example, to create
a schema named `api`, you'd type `ply create-schema api`.

All Sqitch commands are also available, such as `ply sqitch deploy`.

## Installation

Ply runs inside a Docker container, so ensure you have [Docker
installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Create a `ply` command by pasting this into your terminal:

```sh
ply() { docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/migrations:/repo:rw ghcr.io/minibasehq/ply" bash -c "$*" }
```

Add it to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistence.

## Usage

### Initialize a Sqitch project

Run the following command to [initialize a Sqitch
project](https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitch-init/) (be sure to set the
correct database connection URI):

```sh
ply sqitch init --target postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/app myapp
```

### Create Migrations

Let's create a schema named `api` using Ply's DSL:

```sh
ply create-schema api
```

Sqitch creates three SQL files â€“ to deploy, verify and revert the change. The
deploy script is output so you can see the change that will be deployed, and
potentially make changes to it.

> ðŸ“– See the [full list of migration commands](wiki).

### Deploy Migrations

Use Sqitch to deploy changes:

```sh
ply sqitch deploy
```

## Bulk Migration Scripts

Write scripts that create multiple migrations at once. This enables you to
define change sets, or an entire application, at a high level.

For example, create a file named `migrations/create-app.sh`:

```sh
create-schema api
create-table api task
create-function api task_updated
create-trigger api task task_updated task_updated
```

Run the script to create all migrations at once:

```sh
ply bash create-app.sh
```
