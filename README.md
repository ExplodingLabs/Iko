_Iko_ is a Postgres database **schema migration tool**.

It extends [Sqitch](https://sqitch.org/), adding [shell commands](/COMMANDS.md)
to simplify creating common migrations from the command-line.

Combine the commands into [scripts](#scripting) to generate many migrations at
once.

## Installation

Iko runs inside a Docker container, so ensure [Docker is
installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To install the `iko` command, run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://explodinglabs.com/iko/install.sh | sh
```

This creates an executable script at `~/.local/bin/iko`.

Test it's working:

```sh
iko sqitch --version
sqitch (App::Sqitch) v1.5.1
```

If you get a _command not found_ error, make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your
`$PATH`.

## Usage

> üìñ Recommended: [Sqitch
> tutorial](https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitchtutorial/).

### Initialise a Project

Run the following command to initialize a project, ensuring the correct
database URI is set:

```sh
iko init --target db:pg://user:pass@postgres/dbname myapp
```

Keep in mind Iko is running inside a container, so it uses [Docker's
networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/). `localhost` refers to the
container, not the host machine!

> üìñ Refer to the [Sqitch manual for
> init](https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitch-init/).

### Create Migrations

Let's create a schema named `api`:

```sh
$ iko create_schema api
Created deploy/create_schema_api.sql
Created revert/create_schema_api.sql
Created verify/create_schema_api.sql
Added "create_schema_api" to sqitch.plan
create schema api;
```

Here's what happened:

1. Three scripts were created ‚Äì to _deploy_, _revert_ and _verify_ the change.
2. The change was then added to `sqitch.plan`.
3. Lastly, the deploy script was printed for you to review.

> üìñ See the [full list of Iko commands](/COMMANDS.md).

### Deploy

Make sure the database server is running, then type:

```sh
iko deploy
```

> üìñ Refer to the [Sqitch manual for
> deploy](https://sqitch.org/docs/manual/sqitch-deploy/).

## Scripting

Write reusable scripts that generate migrations, for example:

**scripts/auth.sh**

```sh
# Create an auth schema
create_schema auth

# Create an auth.user table
create_table_as auth.user <<'EOF'
create table auth.user (
  username text primary key check (length(username) >= 3),
  password text not null check (length(password) < 512),
  role name not null check (length(role) < 512)
);
EOF

# Create a function that encrypts passwords
create_function_as auth.encrypt_pass <<'EOF'
create function auth.encrypt_pass () returns trigger language plpgsql as $$
begin
  if tg_op = 'INSERT' or new.password <> old.password then
    new.password = crypt(new.password, gen_salt('bf'));
  end if;
  return new;
end; $$
EOF

# Call encrypt_pass when a user is inserted or updated
create_trigger encrypt_pass auth.user auth.encrypt_pass
```

Place it in `scripts/auth.sh` then run:

```sh
iko bash auth.sh
```
